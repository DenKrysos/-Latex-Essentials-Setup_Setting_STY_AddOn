# -Latex-Essentials-Setup_Setting_STY_AddOn

Some essential Code regarding fundamental Project-Setup. E.g. defined additional Functionalities, Macros; stuff that commonly aids every project equally and won't be adjusted as it supplies general tools.
Centrally collected inside a separate Project/Repository to avoid clashes by diverging copies on multiple locations.
This can then be linked or copied on demand into other Documents. (Nothing to compile by itself)

## Overleaf
The Basis for this is actually an Overleaf Project. This is linked with a GitHub-Repository and every now and then synchronized to this. So the Git-Repo is actually "only" a fork of the Overleaf-Project.
