% First, my personal, favourite CHOICE:
%  »algorithmicx« with »algpseudocode«
%
% Now, some more elaboration:
% Your Possibilities to choose:
%    - algorithm - float wrapper for algorithms.
%    - algorithmic/algcompatible - first algorithm typesetting environment.
%    - algorithmicx - second algorithm typesetting environment.
%    - algpseudocode - layout for algorithmicx. 
%    - algorithm2e - third algorithm typesetting environment.
% - - - - - - -
% - "algorithmicx" with "algpseudocode" are superior to "algorithmic"
% - With "\usepackage{algpseudocode}", you don’t need to manually load the algorithmicx package, as this is done by algpseudocode
% - I think "algorithmicx" offers pretty much the same functionality compared to "algorithm2e", but with clearer syntax
% - "algorithmicx" is like "algorithmic" upgraded
% - - - - - - -
%
% With "algpseudocode", there are additional layouts:
% - algcompatible (fully compatible with the algorithmic package),
% - algpascal (aims to create a formatted pascal program, you can transform a pascal program into an algpascal algorithm description with some basic substitution rules).
% - algc (just like the algpascal, but for c. This layout is incomplete).
